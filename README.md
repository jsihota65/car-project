### Create the Car Class with following properties and behaviors (for the behaviors there will be no implementation just conform to the method signatures and return a valid value to match signature, include system out calls to detail what information should be calculated):

Fields/ Properties/ Instance Variables:
String name (any name you may give the instance - ex: "My First Car")
String type (the type of Car- ex: mustang, ford, train, bike)
String color
int numWheels
boolean waterProof
boolean fly
boolean useGas

Methods/ Behaviors/ Functions:
int move()
boolean stop()
boolean reCharge()
void initVehicle()

Override the toString method and Create the following constructors:

Default,
One that takes the name and type
One that takes all properties

Include a test which at minimum collects 10 Cars into an array and executes a System.out call to console with the toString() method being executed on all of them. Also execute all 4 methods on each with unique output to each car. (Use the car properties to make your system out calls unique Ex: The Yellow Mustang moves 3 steps.)
